## Install

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```sh
python app.py
```

Example URL Request:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/jobs?jt=software&jl=california&jn=learning
```
There are 3 Parameters taken, 
```jt``` which takes in a job keyword,
```jl``` which is a location (So far US Cities and States are supported) and
```jn``` parameter which is able to filter jobs based on conditions (we are hoping to make this parameter optional in the near future)

**Note**

If you receive an empty response that generally means there is a captcha blocking the request. As a workaround go to Indeed's website and finish the captcha challenge

## Future Plans

* We hope to support an international search so users outside the US are able to use it

* Find a workaround for the Indeed captcha

* Implement ML to return jobs suitable for any user rather than using only keywords

* and more!
